# Workshop 7 - Packet Capture

We will be looking at some relevant challenges from a beginner-friendly Capture The Flag competition - `picoCTF`.

- Register an account at [picoCTF](https://picoctf.com/)
  - *Play the 2017 Game* -> *Get Started* -> *Officially register for picoCTF 2017*

- Read/watch the backstory if you like, or just skip along to the meaty part: *Level 1*

- Do the two challenges under *FORENSICS* worth 50 points each

**Note:**

- you will need access to Wireshark - it's available in Kali Linux

- download the `.pcap` files and open them up with Wireshark

- Once completed, feel free to try the other challenges as well. This is a decently varied problem set but yet beginner-friendly. Don't be disheartened knowing it's meant for high school students, just Google around and *try harder*!
