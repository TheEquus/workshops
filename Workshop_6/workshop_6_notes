Task 1:
Cracking password using Hashcat 

1) CREATING A TEST USER: 
    open terminal and create a new user who's password we will try to crack. commands: 
    adduser "name" (For example we'll use user1)
    password: "password" (For the sake of simplicty and time efficiency we'll be using a simple passphrase like 'password' or 123456)
    
   After enterring the password, hit Enter for the rest of the fields and it'll choose the default option.
   
2) VIEWING THE HASH PASSWORD: In a Terminal window, execute this command:

    tail /etc/shadow 

The last line shows the password hash for our user. (everyone's hash will be different)
Look at the value following the username "user1". The $6$ value indicates that it's a SHA512 type hash for Unix based OS. 

3) Identifying the hash type: The hash algorithm is defined in the file /etc/login.defs. To see the portion of that file 
discussing the password hash algorithm, execute this grep command to see 18 lines after the line containing the string "ENCRYPT_METHOD":

    grep -A 18 ENCRYPT_METHOD /etc/login.defs 

4) MAKING A HASH FILE:  
In the Terminal window, execute these commands:

    tail -n 1 /etc/shadow > crack1.hash
    
    nano crack1.hash 

In the nano text editor( or vim or leafpad or any text editor you prefer) ,carefully delete the username jose and the colon after it, 
and delete everything after the semicolon at the end of the file including all the colons. So we'll have only the hash and nothing else.
(This part can be a little tricky so don't hesitate ask for help if you're confused about what to do!) 

5) DOWNLOADING THE WORD-LIST:
We'll use a very small list of 500 common passwords.

In a Terminal window, execute these commands:

     curl https://samsclass.info/123/proj10/500_passwords.txt > 500_passwords.txt 

To view the first 10 entries of the file, type in the following command: 
    head 500_passwords.txt 
    
6) CRACKING THE HASH:
In the Terminal window, execute these commands:

     hashcat -m 1800 -a 0 -o found1.txt --remove crack1.hash 500_passwords.txt

    Explanation: This uses hashcat with these options:
    
    Unix type 6 password hashes (-m 1800)
    Using a dictionary attack (-a 0)
    Putting output in the file found1.txt
    Removing each hash as it is found (--remove)
    Getting hashes from crack1.hash
    Using the dictionary 500_passwords.txt 
    
7) VIEWING THE PASSWORD:    
    cat found1.txt
    
    You should see the hash, with the cracked password of "password" at the end separated by a semicolon.

Task 2: 
OveTheWire Challenge - Krypton
http://overthewire.org/wargames/krypton/krypton0.html

1) In Level 0, we see that the password to the the next level is saved as a string encoded with base64 encryption. We can easily crack
   such encryptions using our Kali Terminal. Type in the following commands int the terminal: 
   
    echo 'S1JZUFRPTklTR1JFQVQ=' | base64 --decode
 
 
 2 ) Now we'll have the password as plain-text. Next, the website tells us to this password to log in to krypton.labs.overthewire.org with 
     username krypton1 using SSH on port 2222.  
 
     The terminal commands to connect with the Krypton server:
 
     ssh krypton.labs.overthewire.org -l krypton1 -p 2222 
 
   3) When asked for the password, type the password you found by solving the base64 encoding.
 
 Next Task : Try to complete the next levels of Krypton. (http://overthewire.org/wargames/krypton/krypton2.html)
