SQL workshop


!Task 1 

In this task we will mess around we some basic SQL query. 

()For those who have Kali linux, boot it up and open sql lite. 
()If you don't have Kali linux then make sure you have sql lite install on your laptop and run it. 

Donwload files from gitub.com/umisc. 

Click on Execute SQL and write your query in the field provided below 

1) Make a query to see all the records in the file 
2) Find all the names(first and last) of the users in the table 
3) It seems like Andy played a prank on Hamish and changed his last name. 
Can you figure out what Hamish's real last name is and change it back?
4) Hamish wants revenge on Andy, and wants to mess with his emails. 
Write a query that will return Andy's username and password 
5) The system adminstrator noticed that Hamish and Andy have been messing around on his system.
He's not pleased and is deleting their accounts. Delete Hamish and Andy's records from the system. 
6) Hamish and Andy realized that the system adminstrator has deleted their accounts. 
This means they wouldn't be able to access their club penguins accounts. Oh no!
Hamish and Andy decide to work together, in order to regain their accounts. Insert their details back to the table.
7) Peter Mitchel sees that Hamish and Andy are having a lot of fun messing with the system adminstrator.
He wants to join in on the fun. Delete the entire table. Peter is an odd man.  

!Task 2
Now that you have feeling for how SQL works lets try some SQL injections

Head over to overthewire.
http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/


You can skip straight to level 13->15. The username is natas13. The password to log onto the level is Lg96M10TdfaPyVBkJdjymbllQ5L6qdl1

If you are done with those questions you can move to question 8->9 and 9->10. The username is natats9 and password is W0mMhUcRRnG8dcghE4qvk3JA9lGt8nDl . But keep in mind that this is a code injection question.
#NOTE: in the levels before this you find out the path of the file containing passwords is /etc/natas_webpass/natas10. This is the only information you require from prior levels.

You can try solve level 0 to 3.
These levels are optional since they are not directly related to today's topic but can be solved using a little critical thinking and a hint of googling. 

Level 6 to 8 are doable if you have some experience with programming and were able to solve levels 0 to 3 

Level 3 to 5 contain things we will be addressing later on, therefore it's best to skip them unless you know your stuff.
