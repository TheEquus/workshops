In this workshop, we'll look into the Forensics Challenges of picoCTF 2017.

Task 1: Digital Camouflage
	1) Download the data.pcap file which has the network data and open it with WireShark.
	
	2) Since we want the packets which comes from interaction with a website, the protocol has to be HTTP. 
	   Select or type in http in the filter to show all the packets assosiated with HTTP. 
  	
	3) Find out the file containing POST Request as this file contains additional information about the client
	   after he has entered some form of data, i.e - username and passwords.
	   
   	4) The username and password can be seen under HTML Form URL Encoded. 
	
	5) From our previous workshops we know that text followed by '==' means its base64 encoded. 
	
	6) Decode the string using any base64 cracker website or type in the commands in the terminal :
		echo "string==" | base64 -d
	
	7) And Voila! You now have the password of this challenge.  
	 
	
Task 2: Special Agent User
	1) Download the data.pcap file which has the network data and open it with WireShark.
	
	2) From the hint of the task, we can see that information on browsers can be found on in 'user agent strings'.
	   If you're unfamiliar with this term, googling up is the best option. Look into Wikipedia.
	
	3) Again, we need to filter only HTTP protocols.
	
	4) We'll we two types of files. The files starting with GET represent the request from the client and the ones 
	   starting with HTTP is the response from the browser. So the browser version data will be under GET files.
	   
	5) We have to look under the Hypertext Transfer Protocol tab for the user agent string. We looking at different GET files 
	   until you with the one with browser data.
	   
	6) Type in the browser name and version as directed in the task by the website in the submit section.
